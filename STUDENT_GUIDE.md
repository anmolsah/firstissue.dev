## 🔍 Step 1: Finding Your First Issue

### Using FirstIssue.dev to Discover Issues

1. **Visit the Website**
   - Go to [FirstIssue.dev](https://firstissue.dev)
   - Click "Sign Up" to create your account (it's free!)

2. **Explore Issues**
   - Click on "Explore" in the navigation menu

3. **Use Filters to Find Perfect Issues**
   - **Language Filter**: Choose a programming language you know (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
   - **Label Filter**: Keep it as "good first issue" - these are specifically for beginners!
   - **Keywords**: Add words related to what you want to work on (like "documentation", "bug", "feature")
   - **Sort By**: Choose "Recently Updated" to find active projects

### What Makes a Good First Issue?

Look for issues that have these labels:
